# terraform-aws-iam-chamber-s3-role [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-chamber-s3-role.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-chamber-s3-role) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-chamber-s3-role.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-chamber-s3-role/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision an IAM role with configurable permissions to access [S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html) used by Chamber as [Parameter Store backend](https://github.com/segmentio/chamber#s3-backend-experimental).

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage

This example creates a role with the name `cp-prod-app` with permission to use Chamber with S3 bucket as parameter store,
and gives permission to the entities specified in `assume_role_arns` to assume the role.

```hcl
module "service" {
  source           = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-chamber-s3-role.git?ref=tags/0.1.0"
  enabled          = "true"
  namespace        = "cp"
  stage            = "prod"
  name             = "app"
  principals_arns  = ["${local.kops_roles}"]
  bucket_arn       = "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name"
  services         = ["app", "staging", "default"]
  read_only        = "false"
}
```

### Additional Examples
The [`example`](./example) directory contains complete working examples with variations of how to use the module.
